title: "End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition Systems - PyTorch"
excerpt: "Implement 4 different deep learning architecture (MLP, CNN, RNN, ANN) to parse audio sentences (feature extraction).<br>
- scrape, clean and preprocess audio data<br>
- experiment 4 different architecture for both extractor and classifier layers<br>
- RNN extractor with RNN classifier performs best<br>
