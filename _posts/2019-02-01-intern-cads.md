Monday marks the end of my internship at the Center of Applied Data Science (CADS). I have been offered the internship placement after winning a datathon back in March 2018. I am writing down what I learnt during the six months internship.

## Takeaways
- I was wrong to think that I would not get involved in company politics. Politics exists everywhere.
- Improve communiciation skills.
- Gained new expericence participating in various projects. Though I actually expected have greater growth.
- Experienced working lifestyle. I'll decide whether to work or continue studies later.
- Financial planning - EPF.

## Future Considerations
Factors to consider applying for internship or jobs:
- company culture
- mentorship
- personal growth

## Data Science Department
I reported to Data Science team for the first two months. DS team has a great working culture. They treat each other as equal, asking for help from others is a common. I didn't feel that I'm at the bottom of the pyramid although I'm an intern. Philip, Janice, Sook Yan and Nikki are good colleagues/friends (we are young). Santa and I came a month later than them so they have guided us. I have fond memory here.

DS trains others. I think they themselves should grow more. They do have a skills matrix. But I don't it is implemented with enough significance. Some of the knowledge is too "textbook", where they know the topics but have never really tried using it in real. I would like to suggest so that they check on their skills matrix more often and work on various projects, get more real DS cases, get their hands dirty. I remembered having a conversation of them meeting some other industry people:"what is your position?" " data scientist." "what do you do?" "err.. provides training modules". I hope some day they would be proud to say that they are data scientist from the CADS, not only working on training modules. Have more projects and experience under their belts that they can brag.

Since the flow of talent in tech industry is dynamic, DS team has to ensure there is proper hand over. If a member of the team is leaving, there must be another that can take over the place right after he's gone. To achieve this DS team has to ensure the all has checked and improved their skills matrix, gain more skills. Shadowing is too slow. Train the people so other company would fight for them, but they are staying because they want to stay here. 

## Business Innovation Department
I was suddenly pulled to BI department without knowing anything. I was supposed to be back to DS team after two months but it was an empty promise. BI has a very different culture. Each person did their own tasks. I don't see all of them working at office.

BI has a superior feeling to DS team since they work under CEO. They came up with projects for the company. It is normal for them to request stuff from DS and they think DS team will always comply happily to what they want. It wasn't the truth. DS team has their own opinion. One of the reason this happened I would say is the lack of technical people in BI. The lack of understanding made them difficult to work with DS team and some work went the long way round. For website developing, it would be more efficient to have a team rather than a one-man-show, unless the one-man is up to the task.

Working here I did feel like I'm at the bottom of the pyramid. I don't feel like working in a team. I have to work on whatever I'm assigned to, by anyone. Luckily thanks to my supervisor I could reject coding stuff I don't like. But my supervisor is too busy to have a look at me, leaving me to my own device. I could complete the task, however without mentor the furthest I could go depends on myself. Sad. I wasn't even sure what I did was the right or I could have done it better. Well at least I got some exposure to new topics.

I strongly believe BI should set a clear direction along with realistic, achievable targets. BI has few projects that have been dragged on for far too long. It shouldn't happened. Some projects lose value over time. There's a need to have strict driver and go after it to make sure everything is up to schedule.

## Human Capital
I did not have a good impression of HC even before I came to company. My more-than-a-week application was finally processed after I called Nellie. Instructions were not clear on what to wear, bring etc. until I asked. Luckily they reply email fast and friendly.

Throughout my internship I only see HC people doing their work within their scope, nothing more. Before joining the company I had the impression that HR people will always be smiling and saying hi to everyone, the happy mood bringer. Not here. A lot of stuff that should not happend, did happen. They did not treat employee as company asset. During introduction to newcomers, interns are ignored. I was fine with it, since I'm just an intern I probably shouldn't say too much. Fortunately Linda changed it when I brought it up to her. However the bomb was when HC refused to upgrade the other interns as permanent employee after their probation period had ended. The company almost lost them.

The CADS lacks proper onboarding for newcomers. We are just left to our own department. Newcomers don't get to know the company culture. Even after six months I wasn't really too sure either. I only know DS team and BI department culture.

HC here does not recognise talents. That's sad. I actually came to CADS to pick up Data Science skills but I was moved to BI. I heard another sadder case, to do odd jobs their entire stay at CADS even though they clearly want to get to know Data Science. It is an irony CADS is training people outside the company but does not recognise talents inside. Leverage the right people at the right time.

## Management
Management level is aloof to people like me. I only have the honour to see them when there's meeting. I do feel they're disconnected to the bottom level of the hierachy. I don't think they would know how the members feel deep down below. I believe they are committed to their own task. 

Making changes to the company is hard. Too many levels to go through. Company powerpoint template used to be very ugly. DS team sent proposal with newly designed template. After a few weeks only came the new template. By this time DS need perform extra work to migrate to the new template. 

Communication among departments is also another headache. I had got an order to generate certificates for data star and email them. I finished the job and found out PMO were told to do the same job. Corporate comm said the certificates design was in need of correction after Marketing has blasted out the certificates. Haish. Meeting was held after all the hassle. There was no one to coordinate the whole thing. I believe more of this would happen if there's no solution to it.

I have yet to see great leadership that can lead and mentor the whole team. Leaders eat last.

I often think meeting is a waste of time if not conducted correctly. Management should keep track of the purpose and time of meeting. Management should be time-conscious. 6 people in a one-hour meeting equals six working hours.

CADS is a startup thus I have chances to work with different projects. I personally think the CADS is at a stage to audit itself:
1. Do we have the right talent. Are we recognising them as they are. Are we giving them the training they need.
2. What is our focus and position in the coming five, ten years. Is what we are doing will be leading us to that direction. What should we do more to achieve what we want. Is everyone clear and believe in this mission as well.

DS team has some members with clear idea of what is becoming of the company. They are the experts.

## Memories
What I like very much about the CADS is the flexible working culture. We can come at 8 and leave at 6, but the hardworking hours is 10 to 4. I normally reach office at ten and leave at 5.30, sometimes I stayed until 7 with Santa since the office is so comfy.

CADS is currently located at Komune coworking space. The office was still at Komune 1.0 when I first arrived, but Komune moved to another tower and which is the now Komune 2.0. Moving is exciting! No mood for work. I once visited the old office at ADAX with the grassy floor. I heard the new office is under renovation but too bad it wasn't finished by the time I ended my internship. I will definitely go visit some other day. Someone joked that CADS is very good at relocating.

CADS provides snack. I'm not quite sure why they always have the same Green Peas and Cheerios, too bad I don't like them. My favourite is always milk and the green tea bag. After lunch would be tea time and 4 is cereal with milk. They are the reasons I can stay till 7 in the office. My motivation :).

Permanent staff has incentives. They have unlimited leaves, WFH (work from home), AIA insurance coverage etc. Unlimited leaves is great, but have to ensure people don't abuse it. I saw employees taking regular leave, I'm not sure whether they are using it right. There are also some who don't take leave, in another term: overworked. I like WFH. Sometimes productivity is higher at home, sometimes I don't feel like going to office. Yeah that's the perks of working in tech company.

## Conclusion
I enjoyed the stay at the CADS. I appreciate very much that they did not abuse intern, nothing like making coffee or photocopying jobs. It was a great intern experience which I will bring with me to the future.
